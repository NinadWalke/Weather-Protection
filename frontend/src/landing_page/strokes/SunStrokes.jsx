              Sunstroke, also known as heat stroke, is a severe and potentially
              life-threatening condition that occurs when the body is exposed to
              extreme heat for an extended period, causing the body's
              temperature regulation system to fail. Normally, the body cools
              itself by sweating, but when exposed to high temperatures,
              especially combined with dehydration, the body can no longer
              maintain a safe core temperature. When body temperatures rise
              above 104°F (40°C), the heat overwhelms the body's ability to cool
              down, leading to serious health risks.

              Unlike heat exhaustion, which is a milder form of heat-related
              illness, sunstroke can lead to significant damage to the brain,
              heart, kidneys, and muscles. The longer it takes to lower the body
              temperature, the greater the risk of complications. The condition
              can come on suddenly, often without warning, and requires
              immediate medical attention. If untreated, sunstroke can result in
              long-term organ damage or even death.

              Sunstroke is most commonly seen during periods of extreme heat,
              such as heatwaves, and affects people who spend long hours
              outdoors or engage in strenuous physical activities without proper
              hydration or breaks. The risk is higher for vulnerable groups,
              including the elderly, young children, outdoor workers, and
              individuals with chronic illnesses. Recognizing the signs and
              symptoms early and taking preventive measures is crucial in
              avoiding the potentially fatal effects of sunstroke.
