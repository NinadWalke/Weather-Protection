        <p className="mt-3">
          At Atmost Alert, our mission is to protect individuals from the
          harmful effects of extreme heat and sun exposure, with a focus on
          sunstroke prevention. As global temperatures rise and heatwaves become
          more frequent, it’s crucial to equip people with the right knowledge
          and tools to stay safe. We believe that everyone deserves access to
          timely, reliable information that can help them avoid preventable
          health issues related to excessive heat. By offering weather tracking,
          symptom analysis, and personalized recommendations, we empower our
          users to take control of their health and well-being in hot
          conditions.

          Sunstroke is a serious, sometimes life-threatening condition that
          often goes unnoticed until it’s too late. At Atmost Alert, we are
          deeply committed to raising awareness about the risks of sun exposure,
          especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, children, and
          outdoor workers. Our goal is to not only provide immediate support
          through our tools but also to foster a broader understanding of
          heat-related illnesses. We care about our users' health, and we’re
          passionate about preventing heat-related injuries by offering
          resources that are easily accessible and simple to use.
